Sets up a barebone Flask and React project. To create a project directory `foo`, run `bash path/to/create-flask-react/create.sh foo`. This creates a directory called `foo` in the current working directory. Run `cd foo` and then `source venv/bin/activate`. Run `bash run.sh` to build the Javascript and run the Flask server.
